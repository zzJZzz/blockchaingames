Refresher of adding features.

Also wanted to try out simple.css https://simplecss.org/demo

0. Break down feature to the smallest problem possible.

1. Draw/mock-up screens of the app. Talk it out loud.
   This will give you an idea of what your models will look like and what actions/controllers you'll need.
 
2.Generate any models needed for the feature

2.Update the database with migrations.

4.Generate any controllers needed

5.Edit the routes file to add in your URLs "resources"

6. Add validations and scopes to your models

7.Fill in your controllers with actions
  ```
 def index 
 end
 ```

8. Finishing touches. 

9. Repeat
